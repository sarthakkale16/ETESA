// 10. File I/O and Flushing
// Problem Statement: The program is designed to write a string to a file named log.txt. It appears to execute correctly, but no content is written to the file. The bug is related to the I/O buffer not being flushed before the program terminates.


#include <iostream>#include <fstream>#include <string>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Starting file I/O test..." << std::endl;
    
    std::ofstream logFile("log.txt");
    
    if (logFile.is_open()) {
        std::string message = "This is a log message.";
        logFile << message << std::endl;
        
        std::cout << "Message written to buffer. Exiting..." << std::endl;
        
        // The file is not explicitly closed or flushed here.
        // It relies on the destructor to close the file, but the program
        // might terminate before the destructor is called.
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Error: Unable to open file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
