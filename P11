// 11. Simple Array Iteration
// Problem Statement: The code is designed to iterate through a static array of integers and print each element. However, it crashes or prints garbage values. The bug is a classic off-by-one error in the loop condition.


#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int data[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int sum = 0;
    
    std::cout << "Iterating through the array..." << std::endl;
    
    // The loop condition is incorrect, it accesses memory beyond the array's bounds.
    for (int i = 0; i <= 5; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Accessing element at index " << i << ": ";
        sum += data[i];
        std::cout << data[i] << std::endl;
    }
    
    std::cout << "Total sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
